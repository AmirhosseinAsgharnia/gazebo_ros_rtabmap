# gazebo_ros_rtabmap
This repository has the environment files of our drone lab in Carleton university. The four folder in this repository are four ROS2 packages to simulate a mapping mission. I used RTABMAP to create a map of the lab, using RGB-D camera. I modeled the lab in Gazebo Harmonic. ROS2 Humble was used to handle the communications. The lab CAD files are created in house, while the Parrot Bebop 2 CAD files are downlowded from the following:

I will complete the instruction soon. It will be a good start for using Gazebo Harmonic, ROS2, and RTABMAP.
